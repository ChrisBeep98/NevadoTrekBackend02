# Nevado Trek Backend - Development Context

## Summary of Work Completed

I have successfully implemented the backend for the Nevado Trek tour booking system based on the comprehensive document provided. Here's what has been completed:

### Project Structure Created
- Created proper directory structure following Vercel standards
- Set up package.json with all required dependencies (express, firebase-admin, body-parser, dotenv)
- Created .gitignore to protect sensitive credentials
- Created .env.example for environment variables
- Created comprehensive README.md documentation
- Implemented Vercel configuration (vercel.json)

### Core Backend Implementation
- Created main Express server for local development compatibility
- Implemented Firebase Admin initialization utility in `/lib/firebase.js`
- Developed complete API route structure in the `/api` directory following Vercel standards

### API Routes Implemented
1. **Public Endpoints:**
   - `GET /api/tours` - Get all active tours
   - `GET /api/getTour?tourId={tourId}` - Get specific tour details
   - `POST /api/createBooking` - Create new bookings (creates private events)
   - `POST /api/joinEvent` - Join existing public events
   - `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

2. **Admin Endpoints:**
   - `GET /api/admin/tours` - Get all tours (admin only)
   - `POST /api/admin/tours` - Create new tour
   - `GET /api/admin/bookings` - Get all bookings with optional filters
   - `PUT /api/admin/bookings/[bookingId]/status` - Update booking status
   - `POST /api/admin/events/[eventId]/publish` - Publish events to public

### Key Features Implemented
- **Bilingual Support:** English/Spanish content management as specified
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Based on number of participants using pricingTiers
- **Rate Limiting:** IP-based with 5-minute cooldown (admin override available)
- **Private/Public Events:** All initial events start as private, admin can publish
- **Atomic Operations:** Firebase transactions to prevent race conditions
- **Event Capacity Management:** Max 8 participants per event
- **Booking Status Management:** pending, confirmed, paid, cancelled states
- **Admin Controls:** Full CRUD with secret key authentication
- **Data Denormalization:** To minimize Firestore reads as specified

### Security Features
- X-Admin-Secret-Key header for admin authentication
- Rate limiting to prevent spam
- Proper validation of all inputs
- Secure credential handling via environment variables

## Deployment Status

The project has been successfully deployed to Vercel and connected to the GitHub repository:
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/ChrisBeep98/NevadoTrekBackend02
- Vercel deployment: https://nevado-trek-backend02-jka2-n53ctwb7m.vercel.app
- All sensitive information has been removed from the codebase before pushing

## Current Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables in Vercel
- `ADMIN_KEY`: IsutcY5bNP
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: nevadotrektest01  
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`: firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@nevadotrektest01.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`: (properly formatted with \\n line breaks)

## New Admin Tour Management Features

### Tour Creation API 
Now includes admin endpoints for creating tours via API (no manual Firestore setup needed):
- `POST /api/admin/tours` - Create new tour with full bilingual support
- `GET /api/admin/tours` - Get all tours (admin only)

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Verify Health Check
- Visit: `https://nevado-trek-backend02-jka2-n53ctwb7m.vercel.app/api/health`
- Should return: `{"status":"OK","timestamp":"...","message":"Nevado Trek Backend is running"}`

### 2. Create a Test Tour (Admin Required)
```bash
curl -X POST https://nevado-trek-backend02-jka2-n53ctwb7m.vercel.app/api/admin/tours \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Admin-Secret-Key: IsutcY5bNP" \
  -d '{
    "tourId": "test-tour",
    "name": {
      "es": "Tour de Prueba",
      "en": "Test Tour"
    },
    "shortDescription": {
      "es": "Este es un tour de prueba para validar el sistema",
      "en": "This is a test tour to validate the system"
    },
    "longDescription": {
      "es": "Un tour de prueba para verificar que todo funcione correctamente",
      "en": "A test tour to verify that everything works correctly"
    },
    "pricingTiers": [
      {"pax": 1, "pricePerPerson": 100000},
      {"pax": 2, "pricePerPerson": 90000},
      {"pax": 3, "pricePerPerson": 80000},
      {"pax": 4, "pricePerPerson": 70000}
    ],
    "isActive": true,
    "inclusions": [
      {"es": "Guía profesional", "en": "Professional guide"},
      {"es": "Transporte", "en": "Transportation"}
    ]
  }'
```

### 3. Test Public Endpoints
- Get all tours: `GET https://nevado-trek-backend02-jka2-n53ctwb7m.vercel.app/api/tours`
- Get specific tour: `GET https://nevado-trek-backend02-jka2-n53ctwb7m.vercel.app/api/getTour?tourId=test-tour`

### 4. Test Admin Endpoints
```bash
curl -X GET https://nevado-trek-backend02-jka2-n53ctwb7m.vercel.app/api/admin/tours \
  -H "X-Admin-Secret-Key: IsutcY5bNP"
```

### 5. Test Booking Flow
1. Create a booking:
```bash
curl -X POST https://nevado-trek-backend02-jka2-n53ctwb7m.vercel.app/api/createBooking \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tourId": "test-tour",
    "startDate": "2025-12-15T09:00:00Z",
    "pax": 2,
    "customer": {
      "fullName": "Test Customer",
      "documentId": "CC 123456789",
      "phone": "+1234567890",
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "notes": "No notes"
    }
  }'
```

2. Admin can then publish the event:
```bash
curl -X POST https://nevado-trek-backend02-jka2-n53ctwb7m.vercel.app/api/admin/events/[eventId]/publish \
  -H "X-Admin-Secret-Key: IsutcY5bNP" \
  -d '{}'
```
(Replace [eventId] with the actual event ID returned when booking was created)

## Next Phases

### Phase 11: Full System Testing (Priority)

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Backend logic fully implemented
- ✅ API routes structured for Vercel
- ✅ Security features implemented
- ✅ All business requirements from document addressed
- ✅ Project deployed to Vercel and connected to GitHub
- ✅ Sensitive data removed and repository pushed safely
- ✅ Bilingual support implemented
- ✅ Dynamic pricing and rate limiting configured
- ✅ Private/public event logic completed
- ✅ Admin tour management endpoints added
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured in Vercel
- ✅ Health check endpoint working
- ✅ Basic functionality tested and confirmed

## Current Status

The backend is now fully operational and ready for comprehensive testing. The admin tour creation feature eliminates the need for manual Firestore setup, making the testing process much simpler. The environment variables are correctly configured with proper formatting for the Firebase private key, allowing secure connection to your Firestore database.
